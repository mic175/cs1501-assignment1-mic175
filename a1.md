1.a) The Bogglegame requires us to do the recursive and backtrack algorithm. Therefore, I set up the recursive helper method for each functions in the program to make them easier to run the back track and recursive algorithm. In the helper method, I need to mark the tile first ( with true or UpperCase) and unmark the file in the end (with false or LowerCase) so that we will not do the repeatable process when go through every tile to check every word.

  c) The most common issue I've faced is the indexOutOfBound runtime error. Sometimes I missed the check part for the boundary. Therefore, the tile checking will go beyond of the boggle even if it is at the bound of boggle. To solve it, I add the check condition "if (row < 0 || row >= board.length || col < 0 || col >= board[0].length || visited[row][col] || board[row][col] != word.charAt(index)) {
        return false; // Out of bounds or character mismatch
    }" to check its bound

2. a) generateBoggleBoard Method
Complexity: O(n^2)
b)countWords and countWordsOfCertainLength Methods
Complexity: O(n^2 * 8^m * w)
c) isWordInDictionary Method
Complexity: O(w)
d)anyWord and anyWord (with length) Methods
Complexity: O(n^2 * 8^m * w)
e)anyWord and anyWord (with length) Methods
Complexity: O(n^2 * 8^m * w)
f)checkTiles Method
Complexity: O(w)

w: Represents the length of the word being searched for or the average length of the words in the dictionary if multiple words are being considered. In the methods isWordInDictionary and checkTiles, w refers to the length of the word that is being checked.
m: Represents the maximum length of a word that can be formed on the board or the specific length of a word when searching for words of a certain length.

Factors Affecting Performance
Number of words in the dictionary: While this affects the time to build the dictionary, it does not directly affect the time complexity of searches within the dictionary if a Trie is used, as each search is dependent on the length of the word, not the number of words in the dictionary.
Number of characters in a word: This affects the depth of the DFS, which has an exponential impact on the runtime due to the backtracking process.
Board size: As the board size increases, the number of cells increases quadratically, which linearly increases the number of initial DFS calls.
