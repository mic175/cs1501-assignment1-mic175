Additional comments (including problems and extra credit):
______My problem is that there's something wrong with my __makeWorldInBorad function. I don't think that 

there's some problems with my logic with my recursive and backtrack__algorithm, and I can also compile and run it in the 

Main.java. However, the output in the autograder shows: Got null from markWordInBoard but ode exists in board; expected: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)],

which confuses me a lot._____________________________________
